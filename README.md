# Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge - Day 3 Complete ⚡

Welcome to my **Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge** Day 3 submission!

This repository contains my implementation of the **Health & Wellness Voice Companion** - a supportive daily check-in agent with JSON persistence.

## 🎯 Challenge Task

**Day 3 Objective**: Build a health and wellness voice companion that conducts daily check-ins and stores data in JSON.

### Primary Goal ✅
- Clear, grounded system prompt for wellness companion
- Daily check-ins via voice about mood, energy, and goals
- JSON file persistence for all check-ins
- Reference past data in new conversations

### What I Built:

✅ Supportive, non-medical wellness companion
✅ Daily check-in conversation flow:
  - Mood assessment
  - Energy level check
  - Stress/concerns inquiry
  - 1-3 daily objectives/intentions
  - Simple, actionable advice
  - Recap and confirmation
✅ JSON-based persistence (`wellness_log.json`)
✅ Previous check-in context loading
✅ Natural reference to past sessions
✅ 5 function tools for data collection:
  - `set_mood()` - Record current mood
  - `set_energy()` - Record energy level
  - `set_stress()` - Note stress/concerns
  - `add_objective()` - Add daily goals
  - `add_note()` - Additional reflections
  - `complete_checkin()` - Save to JSON log

### What I Accomplished:

✅ Set up the complete development environment (Python 3.11, Node.js, pnpm, uv)
✅ Configured backend with Murf Falcon TTS integration
✅ Configured frontend Next.js application
✅ Downloaded and set up LiveKit Server
✅ Successfully connected all services (LiveKit, Backend Agent, Frontend)
✅ Had my first real-time voice conversation with the AI agent
✅ Pushed code to GitHub repository

## 🎯 Day 2 Task - Coffee Shop Barista Agent

**Status: ✅ Complete (including Advanced Challenge)**

### What I Built:

✅ Created "Brew" - a friendly barista persona at Murf's Coffee House
✅ Implemented order state management system
✅ Built 6 function tools for order collection:
  - `set_drink_type()` - Capture coffee type
  - `set_size()` - Set drink size (small/medium/large)
  - `set_milk()` - Choose milk preference
  - `add_extra()` - Add extras like whipped cream, syrups, etc.
  - `set_customer_name()` - Get customer name
  - `complete_order()` - Validate and save order to JSON
✅ Orders automatically saved to `backend/orders/` directory with timestamp
✅ Agent asks clarifying questions to fill all required fields
✅ **Advanced Challenge: Real-time HTML Beverage Visualization**
  - Dynamic coffee cup rendering that updates in real-time
  - Cup size changes based on order (small/medium/large)
  - Visual whipped cream topping when ordered
  - Animated drink filling effect
  - Live order details display
  - Completion status indicator
  - Data streaming via LiveKit data channels
✅ Order history display during session
✅ Compact UI that doesn't obstruct conversation
✅ Starbucks-inspired green theme
✅ Persistent beverage display until session ends
